              <p class="tags"><u>Subscription Manager</u></p>
              <p>
                This is my Senior Year Capstone Project. This was done for a client, <a href="https://moneytree.com/"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">
                <u >Moneytree</u></a>. Part of <a href="https://moneytree.com/"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">
                <u >Accutech</u></a>. The project is written using VueJS for the frontend framework, with an ASP.Net Web API for the backend. I signed an NDA before working on this project, so I cannot link any code. But, I can describe it as best as possible.</p>
                The project consists of three parts:
                <ul>
                  <li>A Bulk Signup Software</li>
                  <li>A Subscription Manager Dashboard Software</li>
                  <li>A User Onboarding Software</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Bulk Signup Software is a solution to companies having to submit a form for every individual they want to signup for Moneytree products. It allows the user to dynamically add and fillout as many signups as they want (to the limit of 20).
                  This allows the user to fill out payment information only one time. This signup information is submitted to a thirdparty service, <a href="https://www.maxio.com/chargify" target="_blank"rel="noopener noreferrer"><u >Maxio</u></a>,
                  which handles their product subscriptions. </p>
                <p>The Susbcription Manager Dashboard is a software which exists under each of Moneytree's different prodcts, with a dashboard specifically written for each product. The dashboard pulls relevant information about the signed in customer,
                  as well as relevant information for the product they are signed into. The user can view all information, update their billing/personal information, and view/pay invoices.
                </p>
                <p>The User Onboarding Software is a software which asks the user multiple questions when they are signing up, granting Moneytree more information to taylor their experience too.</p>
                <p>All of the information gathered/pulled in this project was gotten from or store in Maxio.</p>
                <p>I took most of the lead on this project, by planning meetings with the team/client each week, and also encouraging communication between team members. I also planned out each iteration.</p>

              <p class="tags"><u>The Perfect Bet</u></p>
              <p>
                This was a program completely focused on sports betting. The
                project started off just focusing on NFL games, and would update
                week to week with current matchups. A free sports betting API
                was used to get the matchups, as well as the odds for each game.
                The user was able to select a matchup from a list of games, and
                enter a bet amount on one team. Using the odds, and the amount
                placed, the program would calculate their potential winnings. 
                </p>
                <p>In
                later iterations, NBA and NHL games were added. A feature was
                also added that allowed the user to select certain important
                statistics from a specific sport. The selected statistics for
                the selected team would display which allowed the user to make a
                more informed bet. There was a heavy emphasis placed on unit
                testing in this project using JUnit, and JavaFX was used to
                create the GUI. This project was a 10+ week project during my
                second year.

                  ><u>Repository</u></a
                ><br /><br />Note that this is a backup repository which simply
                holds the original files. The original repository was deleted by
                the professor at the end of the semester.

              <p>
                This was a short, few week project, which simply used an API to
                get the recent edits/additions to a Wikipedia article. It
                displayed the timestamp of the edit, and the author. JavaFX was
                used to create the GUI which displayed the changes.

              <p class="tags"><u>Image Filter Project</u></p>
              <p>
                This was a project during my first year. It was a simple Python
                program, which took an image file as input. Multiple functions
                were created which applied various filters to the image. A
                couple of examples of said filters were a color inverting filter
                and a filter which horizontally flipped a section of the image.
                The end results of the edited image were displayed in a small
                art show for the Freshman.
