                This was a program completely focused on sports betting. The
                project started off just focusing on NFL games, and would update
                week to week with current matchups. A free sports betting API
                was used to get the matchups, as well as the odds for each game.
                The user was able to select a matchup from a list of games, and
                enter a bet amount on one team. Using the odds, and the amount
                placed, the program would calculate their potential winnings. In
                later iterations, NBA and NHL games were added. A feature was
                also added that allowed the user to select certain important
                statistics from a specific sport. The selected statistics for
                the selected team would display which allowed the user to make a
                more informed bet. There was a heavy emphasis placed on unit
                testing in this project using JUnit, and JavaFX was used to
                create the GUI. This project was a 10+ week project during my
                second year.

                This was a short, few week project, which simply used an API to
                get the recent edits/additions to a Wikipedia article. It
                displayed the timestamp of the edit, and the author. JavaFX was
                used to create the GUI which displayed the changes.

                This was a project during my first year. It was a simple Python
                program, which took an image file as input. Multiple functions
                were created which applied various filters to the image. A
                couple of examples of said filters were a color inverting filter
                and a filter which horizontally flipped a section of the image.
                The end results of the edited image were displayed in a small
                art show for the Freshman.
